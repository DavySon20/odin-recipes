    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and sliced thinly</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>2 pounds pork belly, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh shrimp paste</li>
        <li>1 can (13.5 ounces) coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>14 pieces Thai chili peppers, stemmed and minced</li>
        <li>2 cups finger chilies (siling haba), sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut cream</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In a wide pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened.</li>
        <li>Add pork and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Add shrimp paste and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add coconut milk, water, and chili peppers. Bring to a simmer and cook for about 35 to 35 minutes or until pork is tender and liquid is reduced and begins to render fat.</li>
        <li>Add finger chilies and cook, stirring regularly, for about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add coconut cream and continue to simmer until thickened and begins to render fat.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make slicing easier, freeze the pork belly until partially firm.</li>
        <li>Coconut milk tends to curdle or separate when brought to a boil or heated too quickly. Cook in a gentle simmer to ensure a smooth, creamy sauce..</li>
        <li>If you'd like to add vegetables, you can use cut sigarilyas, long beans (sitaw) or string beans.</li>
        <li>If you're in the U.S. and have only access to the bottled "neon pink" shrimp paste, you might want to rinse it and drain well before using
            <p>in the recipe to rid of the extra saltiness and the bright color that might otherwise bleed into the dish.</p></li>
    </ol>
