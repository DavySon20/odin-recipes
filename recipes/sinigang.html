    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds beef short ribs</li>
        <li>10 cups water</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>2 large Roma tomatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>6 gabi, peeled and halved depending on size</li>
        <li>2 finger chilies</li>
        <li>1 (6 inches) radish (labanos), peeled and cut into ½-inch thick on a bias</li>
        <li>15 large tamarind pieces or 1 ½ (1.41 ounces each) packages tamarind base powder</li>
        <li>1 bunch kangkong</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pot over medium heat, combine beef ribs and water. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top. </li>
        <li>When the broth has cleared, add onions, tomatoes, and fish sauce. </li>
        <li>Lower heat, cover, and cook for 1 to 1 ½ hours or until meat is fork-tender.</li>
        <li>Add gabi and cook for about 6 to 8 minutes or until soft. </li>
        <li>Add chili and radish. Continue to simmer for about 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Trim about 2 inches from the kangkong stalks and discard. Cut kangkong into 3-inch lengths, separating the sturdier stalks from the leaves.</li>
        <li>If using packaged tamarind base, add into the pot and stir until completely dissolved. Season with salt and pepper to taste. </li>
        <li>Add kangkong stems and cook for a minutes. Add leaves and continue to cook for about 1 minute. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>If Using Fresh Tamarind</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash tamarind and place in a pot with 1 cup water. Bring to a boil and cook until soft and outer skins begin to burst.</li>
        <li>With a fork, mash tamarinds.</li>
        <li>In a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl, pour tamarind and liquid. 
         Continue to mash with a fork, returning some of the liquid into the strainer once or twice, to fully extract the juice.</li>
        <li>Discard seeds and skins. Pour tamarind juice into the sinigang.</li>
    </ol>
